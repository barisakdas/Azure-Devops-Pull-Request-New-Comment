## Adding new comment to Azure Devops pull request.

In this project, I made a study that allows us to add the results from the projects we control on SonarQube as comments to the pull requests of the project on Azure devops. Here, you can easily add comments that will come from not only SonarQube, but also from any place you want, or that you will produce yourself, on Azure Devops. You can use Azure Devops APIs for this work. I also used them in my project. I don't think there are any apps that do this for free. Therefore, you can easily benefit from my work.

## Steps
